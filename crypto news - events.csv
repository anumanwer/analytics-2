The Football Pools started 90 years ago this year. Within months, hundreds of thousands of fans were filling in weekly coupons, attempting to predict Saturday afternoon's results in the hope of winning cash prizes. In 1961, Viv Nicholson, a factory worker from Castleford, won a £152,000 jackpot, equivalent to almost £5m today. More than £3.2bn in winnings has been paid to 61m people over the years and more than 500,000 people still play the pools each week. In the recent years, there are many changes. The growth of the internet and mobile devices with quick access to odds has made betting generally much more accessible. Satellite television channels and increased coverage of live football matches around the world has increased interest and opportunity. With it has come the widespread use of ""in-running"" betting, where punters can stake money on the action as it happens - for example, who will score the next goal, with odds fluctuating on the pattern of play. Online football betting has mushroomed since it first became significant before the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000. How much is the sports betting industry worth? ""The current estimations, which include both the illegal markets and the legal markets, suggest the sports match-betting industry is worth anywhere between $700bn and $1tn (£435bn to £625bn) a year,"" says Darren Small, director of integrity at betting and sports data analysts Sport-radar. About 70% of that trade has been estimated to come from trading on football. With the great potential of this SPECIAL industry, BENICOIN has been researched in a long time and developed with online platforms where you can bet any football matches anywhere, with any whom easily/speedily and clearly. Releasing the not good points of Traditional Football Betting methods, the block-chain technology has created wonderful experiences for Punters, removes all the barriers among them.
